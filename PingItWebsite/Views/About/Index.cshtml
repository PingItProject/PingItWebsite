                <h3>Why Ping It?</h3>
                <p></p>
                    Ping It is a free, peer-based web-service aiming to help users fight the repeal of net neutrality. It includes comprehensive information aiming to help users fight the repeal of net neutrality regulations.
                <p></p>

                <h3>What’s happening?</h3>
                    In December 2017, The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to discard 
                net neutrality rules which required broadband providers to enable access to all sites equally. 
                Though there are countless lawsuits due to challenge the repeal, it is a real possibility 
                that broadband providers will soon throttle access to websites not owned by them, 
                and otherwise may require consumers and website owners alike to pay for “premium” 
                web services. While these measures would impact any website or web service, 
                those most negatively impacted will likely be consumers and small business owners.
                <p></p>
                    We wanted to create a site that would increase user awareness of how the repeal 
                of net neutrality will impact them. `
